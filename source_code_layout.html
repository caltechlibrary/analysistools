<h1 id="source-code-layout">Source Code Layout</h1>
<p>The source code originated from porting a Python proof of concept to
Go. The primary result is a single command line tool (at present) called
<strong>phrasecheck</strong>. It can produce CSV output for four
different analysis.</p>
<dl>
<dt>mimetypes</dt>
<dd>
least files in a directory reporting on filename and possible mime type
</dd>
<dt>filetypes</dt>
<dd>
walk a directory and list the file extensions found along a count.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>check ; check files against a pattern list and report occurrences
where the pattern was found</p>
<dl>
<dt>check-directory</dt>
<dd>
walk a directory and check each file against a pattern list. Only works
for UTF-8 text files.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The two reports, mimetypes and filetypes are drive by the directory
walk functin in <a href="filetypes.go">filetypes.go</a>. This file also
includes a hard coded Mime Type map from extension to mime type. If the
extension is not in the list the “application/octet-stream” is
returned.</p>
<p>The check and check-directory reports are defined primarily in <a
href="tokenizer.go">phrasecheck.go</a>. This file also includes the
support for the command line tool (i.e. “Run()” function). The check
function rely on a stream of tokens. Each token has a value, work number
and line number. The check function in phrasecheck.go use the token list
for comaparison and reporting.</p>
<p>The <a href="tokenizer.go">tokenizer.go</a> file contains the
tokenizer functions as well as defining the struct of the tokens
returned. The allows you to read a file once, get a single token list
and perform multiple analysis on the token list without needing to
reread it from disk for each analysis. The token list will need to fit
in memory so for extremely large files this may fail.</p>
<p>The <a href="version.go">version.go</a> is generated by CMTools. It
holds the version, license and release information for the program or
other projects that use the analysistools module.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="helptext.go">helptext.go</a></dt>
<dd>
This is the file that holds all the helptext in the application. That
output of the help content is used by the Makefile to generate man pages
via Pandoc.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="standard-development-files">Standard development files</h2>
<dl>
<dt>codemeta.json</dt>
<dd>
This is the primary repository metadata file. It is used by CMTools to
generate everything from the version.go to various bits of
documentation.
</dd>
<dt>CITATION.cff</dt>
